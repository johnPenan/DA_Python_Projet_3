# PROJECT 3: Help MacGyver escape

MacGyver would have been locked in a 2D labyrinth. This project allows MacGyver to create a syringe with a needle, a small plastic tube and ether to put the guard to sleep and escape.

## Getting started

These instructions allow you to obtain a copy of the project to test it on your machine.

### Prerequisites

As the program is written in Python, it is essential that it is installed on your machine. You can download Python:
* [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

### Installation

In order not to conflict with other existing projects, it is best to run the program in a virtual environment.
Here are the main commands for :

1. Creating a virtual environment 

mac/linux : ```sudo pip3 install pipenv```
windows : ```pip install pipenv ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

windows/mac/linux : ```pipenv shell```

3. Install python module : ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 

For more details on setting up a virtual environment, see the Python documentation
* [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=virtual+environment)  

## Start-up

Once the console has been placed in the program folder, simply run the following command in the virtual environment:

```python3 main.py```

## Development done with:
